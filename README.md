## Introduction

Even though Supermarket can choose to remain a physical store or enter the ever-growing world of e-commerce, Supermarket remains popular in terms of retail sales, especially shopping for groceries and household necessities. Understanding client behavior is essential in the retail market so that organizations can adjust their marketing offers and campaigns accordingly. As a first step, the Supermarket asked the Data Analyst team to conduct analysis on customer data owned by the Supermarket.

The data provided is a Dataset of Customers who have subscribed to the Supermarket in the period 2012 to 2014. The data set consists of customer data points, each of which represents a unique consumer interaction with the supermarket. This includes a variety of characteristics, such as demographic information, shopping patterns, response to marketing campaigns, and so on.

The data set, containing more than 2,000 items, provides a very useful source of information for analyzing customer relationship dynamics in the supermarket context.

## Problem Statements

By analyzing customer behavior over the last two years in Supermarket, `Market Strategy` will be formulated to help Supermarket businesses adapt their products based on target customers from various types of customers. The core objective of this project is to drive the formulation of market strategies by analyzing `Customer Shopping Behavior` and to improve the effectiveness of campaigns. Additionally, the company seeks to understand customer segmentation and identify potential areas for growth and development. This information will play an important role in designing more strategic and effective campaigns in the future.

    Key Question:
    1. What insights can we gain into customers purchasing behavior based on their demographic information?
    2. What potential areas can be developed or improved for future campaigns and sales?
    3. How does the Supermarket perform in building its marketing strategy?
